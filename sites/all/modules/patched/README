This directory holds upstream contrib modules that have required patches for
some specific functionality. The policy in this directory is to download the
module, check it in to Git, apply your patches, including a URL to the d.o
issue ticket in the commit message if there is one.

When it comes time to update one of these modules, download the new version
and apply the same patches again, if necessary.
